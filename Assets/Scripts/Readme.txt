Chloe
4 features:
1. Local multi player, 2 bears.
2. Shoot projectile. 
3. Zone control.

Details for feature 2+3:
Several zones. The bear can shoot projectile into zones. 
When there are enough balls in the zone(And more than another bear), the area belongs to you. 
Also, you can use a mop(Secondary weapon) to push the projectile away. 
Grab different weapons with limited projectile in different weapon Spawn Point.   
The mop will disappear if you throw away, so you need to wait for another one. 

Limited time to see which bear occupies the most area.
     
Or maybe just make the floor different color to distinguish zones like Splatoon.

4. Display the amount of the zone controlled by each bear in the Gamescreen.
